                            The new drug has yet to be approved, but in small clinical trials has shown impressive

                            The move comes just days after Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and
                            WhatsApp, said it was ending a fact-checking programme criticised by President-elect Donald
                            Trump and Republicans.

                            In a memo to staff about its decision, which affects, hiring, supplier and training efforts,
                            Meta cited a "shifting legal and policy landscape".

                            Walmart and McDonalds are among the other companies to have made similar decisions regarding
                            diversity efforts since Trump won re-election.</p>
